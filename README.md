# Tourmate 🧭

Tourmate is a simple and helpful travel app built using React Native with Expo Go. It helps users find nearby hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions using Google Places API. It also shows useful details like ratings, phone numbers, and addresses — plus you can even see places using Google Street View.

I created this app as a personal project to combine Firebase, Google APIs, and React Native into one useful tool for travelers.
